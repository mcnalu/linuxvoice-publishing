#Markdown

A blank line starts a new paragraph. A # character at the start of a new line is a top level (h1) heading. One * either side of a word is *italic* and two is **bold**.

##An h2 heading

Lists begin after a blank line and items start with numbers and a period like this:

1. First things first
2. Or you can use * or - at the start of a line for bullets
