<h1>Markdown</h1>
<p>A blank line starts a new paragraph. A # character at the start of a new line is a top level (h1) heading. One * either side of a word is <em>italic</em> and two is <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<h2>An h2 heading</h2>
<p>Lists begin after a blank line and items start with numbers and a period like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First things first</li>
<li>Or you can use * or - at the start of a line for bullets</li>
</ol>
